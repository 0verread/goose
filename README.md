#### Why?

I take a lot of notes and create long list of TODOs when I'm working on big feature - what i'm missing, what i should do before merging, etc. things like that are essential but not comes in structure building process. e.g. if db schema is changed, make sure I create migration file before merging. Things like this I shouldn't be doing while building because schema can change but I have to keep a note of it. kinda checklist for branch feature. this CLI tool serves that purpose -  it provies you to create checklist for each branch. You can use it to break down your big feature into small actions i.e. TODO list.
